# EEG-Functional-Connectivity-Analysis
This project analyzes EEG signals to explore brain connectivity patterns in healthy vs Alzheimer patients. 

IMPORTANT: Note that the code posted is very simplified and does not match the sample result posted. This is due to the university's plagiarism rules. The actual project was much more detailed. 

## Description
- Processed EEG signals using Python.
- Applied correlation, coherence, and phase-locking value (PLV) to compute connectivity in a team. 
- Visualized results using adjacency matrices and plots.
- Demonstrates signal processing, data visualization, and analysis workflow.
- For this project i was in charge of the PLV data 

## Data
- Uses synthetic EEG signals and open-source datasets for demonstration.
