# EEG-Functional-Connectivity-Analysis
This project analyzes EEG signals to explore brain connectivity patterns in healthy vs Alzheimer patients. 


## Description
- Processed EEG signals using Python.
- Applied correlation, coherence, and phase-locking value (PLV) to compute connectivity in a team. 
- Visualized results using adjacency matrices and plots.
- Demonstrates signal processing, data visualization, and analysis workflow.
- For this project i was in charge of the PLV data 

## Data
- Uses synthetic EEG signals and open-source datasets for demonstration.
